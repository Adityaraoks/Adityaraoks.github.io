        <h1>Deep Dives: My 2025 Musts — Books and Documentaries</h1>
        
        <p>I usually write a blog post celebrating the books, documentaries, and podcasts I love to mark the year that passed. This year was a bit strange for me in terms of reading; I read fewer books overall and spent more time finishing the ones I started. I have a bad habit of finishing the book I start, even when I don't like it, a habit I want to change this year. Given that I have fewer books to review, I thought of combining books with documentaries that I love the most. In the end, as usual, I also provide my tentative reading list for the year.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Reads</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gods, Guns and Missionaries — Manu Pillai:</strong> It is a historical narrative exploring the evolution of modern Hindu identity over four centuries, shaped by encounters with European missionaries, colonial powers, and internal reformers. The book traces how Hinduism, originally diverse and fluid, crystallised in response to external pressures. To be honest, I was expecting a more fun ride, just like <em>Anarchy</em> by William Dalrymple, which was not to be.</li>
            <li><strong>Go Tell It on the Mountain — James Baldwin:</strong> I loved this book because it captures raw family drama and spiritual struggle in 1930s Harlem with such vivid emotion. John's 14th birthday and his intense church awakening struck a chord with me, showing the heavy weight of guilt, faith, and identity. It is perfect for anyone who enjoys deep, personal stories about growing up.</li>
            <li><strong>Rumi's Little Book of Life: The Garden of the Soul, the Heart, and the Spirit — Rumi:</strong> I never cared much for poetry until I grabbed this at the airport on my way to the AERA conference. Each short poem hits deep with simple wisdom about life, love, and the spirit. Now I can flip open any page, read one quick piece, and think about it for days.</li>
            <li><strong>On Muscle: The Stuff That Moves Us and Why It Matters — Bonnie Tsui:</strong> I have been on my personal fitness journey for a year now, and this book got me hooked right away. It blends science, stories, and real-life grit to show why strong muscles matter for health and resilience, especially for someone like me balancing running and strength training.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Favourite Documentaries</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wyngx:</strong> A popular YouTube channel focused on cinematic documentaries about aviation accidents. It stands out for its compelling storytelling that builds suspense like a thriller and thorough technical breakdowns using real data (e.g., CCTV, satellite footage). Go check out the videos, and thank me later.</li>
            <li><strong>The Thinking Game:</strong> This is a must-watch for anyone who loves learning about AI. It chronicles DeepMind's journey from a startup to solving the complex protein-folding problem with AlphaFold, revealed through insider interviews and archival footage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reading list for 2026</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships</em> by Eric Berne.</li>
            <li><em>Greatest Works of Edgar Allan Poe</em></li>
            <li><em>How Not to Age: The Scientific Approach to Getting Healthier</em> by Michael Greger, M.D</li>
            <li><em>The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma</em> by Bessel van der Kolk, M.D</li>
            <li><em>World's Greatest Classics:</em> Mary Shelley; Marcus Aurelius; Jane Austen; Sun Tzu; Oscar Wilde.</li>
            <li><em>Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience</em> by Pim van Lommel.</li>
        </ol>
