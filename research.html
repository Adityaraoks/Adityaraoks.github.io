  <h2>Research Themes and Approach</h2>

  <h3>Agricultural Policy Evaluation</h3>
  <p>
    My research focuses on evaluating the impact and effectiveness of agricultural policies in India, with particular emphasis on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Crop Insurance:</strong> Analyzing adoption patterns, willingness to pay, and impact of weather-based crop insurance schemes.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Support Prices (MSP):</strong> Examining awareness, impact on crop diversification, and effects on farm-gate prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Credit:</strong> Evaluating institutional credit access, Kisan Credit Card schemes, and their impact on farm households.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This research stream aims to provide evidence-based insights for policy refinement and development to better support agricultural communities across India.
  </p>

  <h3>Water-Energy-Food Nexus</h3>
  <p>
    Investigating the critical interconnections between scarce water resources, clean energy solutions, and food production systems in India. My work in this area includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems:</strong> Examining stakeholder perceptions, adoption challenges, and policy preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Irrigation Development:</strong> Analyzing distribution patterns, equity implications, and sustainable water management.</li>
    <li><strong>Micro-irrigation:</strong> Studying adoption trends, distributional patterns, and potential correlates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This research contributes to understanding and addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of water management, renewable energy adoption, and food security in India.
  </p>

  <h3>COVID-19 Impact on Food Security</h3>
  <p>
    Examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and agricultural systems in India, with a focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Food insecurity dynamics in rural areas during the pandemic</li>
    <li>Vulnerability factors affecting household food security</li>
    <li>Policy responses and intervention strategies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides insights into the resilience of food systems during crisis situations and informs future policy preparedness.
  </p>

  <h2>Methodological Expertise</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Impact Assessment Methods</li>
    <li>Mixed Methods Research</li>
    <li>Discrete Choice Experiments</li>
    <li>Structural Equation Modelling</li>
    <li>National Dataset Analysis</li>
    <li>Q Method and Content Analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Collaborations</h2>
  <p>
    I actively collaborate with researchers and institutions around the world, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
